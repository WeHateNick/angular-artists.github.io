        "bio": "The strange, shimmering star at the center of the early 2000s psych-pop revival, Animal Collective garnered both critical plaudits and rabid, devoted acolytes by blending Brian Wilson-esque vocal harmonies with spaced-out instrumentation, tribal percussion and odd ribbons of sound. As their name implies, the group is more a loose aggregation of performers rather than a standard rock band. Each of the members assumes a kind of nom de psych under which they record: David Portner is Avey Tare, Noah Lennox is Panda Bear, Josh Dibb is Deacon and Brian Weitz calls himself Geologist. The names add an air of both mystery and personality to an already bizarre and singular group. It's music is defined by a sonic restlessness, and an ability to change sounds and styles — sometimes radically — from album to album. -Rolling Stone",
